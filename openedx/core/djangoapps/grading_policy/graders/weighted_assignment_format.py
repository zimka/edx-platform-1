    """
    Grades all sections matching the format 'type' taking into account a weight. A specified
    number of lowest scores can be dropped from the calculation. The minimum number of
    sections in this format must be specified (even if those sections haven't been
    written yet).

    min_count defines how many assignments are expected throughout the course. Placeholder
    scores (of 0) will be inserted if the number of matching sections in the course is < min_count.
    If there number of matching sections in the course is > min_count, min_count will be ignored.

    show_only_average is to suppress the display of each assignment in this grader and instead
    only show the total score of this grader in the breakdown.

    hide_average is to suppress the display of the total score in this grader and instead
    only show each assignment in this grader in the breakdown.

    If there is only a single assignment in this grader, then it acts like a SingleSectionGrader
    and returns only one entry for the grader.  Since the assignment and the total are the same,
    the total is returned but is not labeled as an average.

    category should be presentable to the user, but may not appear. When the grade breakdown is
    displayed, scores from the same category will be similar (for example, by color).

    section_type is a string that is the type of a singular section. For example, for Labs it
    would be "Lab". This defaults to be the same as category.

    short_label is similar to section_type, but shorter. For example, for Homework it would be
    "HW".

    starting_index is the first number that will appear. For example, starting_index=3 and
    min_count = 2 would produce the labels "Assignment 3", "Assignment 4"
